    <h1 id="titleId">Fundamentals of HTML</h1>
    <h3>Text Formatting</h3>
    <p>A paragraph with <i>some words</i> that are <i>emphasized</i> and <strong>some important words.</strong> Followed by some <mark>highlighted words.</mark> Feel free to add any other text formatting htat appeals to you.As mentioned I adding a <b>bold text here.</b> </p>
    
    <pre>
        This is some text
        that is laid out exactly as 
        Laid out at code level without any additional 
        markup
    </pre>

    <h3>Special Characters</h3>
    <p>The browser thinks &lt; is a programming character. Also &gt;. The browser also ignores any line breaks <br> in your code and any&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;white space. To include these you need to use special characters aka html character entities.
    There are other entites avaiable such as &pound; and &amp;</p>

    <h3>Links</h3>
    <p>A web page without any links is a unique and peculiar find. You can have links to sparate sites such as <a href="https://www.leedsbeckett.ac.uk/">Leeds Beckett</a> Links to other pages of the <a href="second.html">same site.</a> Links to another point in the <a href="#titleId">same page.</a></p>

    <h3>Images</h3>
    <img src="/WeeklyAssignment/image/week1Image.jpeg" alt="Week 1 Image" width="100" height="100">
    <p>The image is stored on this server in an image sub-folder</p>
    <p>I hope you added an alt attribbute to support screen readers</p>
    <p>Why not check to see what happens if you try to validate your code using the W3C Markup Validation Service without the alt attribute included. If you right click on your page and chose inspect or view source you can check your code and see the HTML comment  you have added just inside the body tag</p>

    <br>
    <p>Notes:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>The final para is automatically word wrapped by the browser and does not contain a line break.</li>
        <li>The image has been prepared as small 100x100 image prior to inclusion on the page</li>
        <li>To create a link to another page a simple second page will be needed - put a return link on that page</li>
        <li>To test the intrapage link you will probably need to resize the browser so that only a narrow vertical window is open</li>
    </ul>
